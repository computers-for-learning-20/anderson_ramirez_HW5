## Implementation Notes:
* The Particle System was used to create two types of particles (extra credit):
  1. Small sparkles to highlight goal objects.
  2. Larger bursts when a goal is collected.
* The halo effect was also applied to our goal materials.
* Simple animation added to the N_ShapedObstacle: moves from one side to another.
